## Summary

This is the first of five assigned projects on The Odin Project Foundations course! Created this website and it consists of the main index page having links to a few recipes. In this assignment, I learned how to create an HTML boilerplate, created a directory from the command terminal, and vs code. I also learned how to create paragraphs, links, images, and unordered lists for my recipes.
